# HyperOS

The HyperOS source tree - formerly Infinex project

This is a custom operating system based on the kernel created by David Callanan – [Click me for more](https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series/)

The operating system boots, and displays the text, «WELCOME TO HYPER OS!».

`Next planned feature:` Adding keyboard support.

_NB:_ This will soon be merged with the [Digital Sledgehammer](https://github.com/LukeChemeriov/)Digital-Sledgehammerproject.
